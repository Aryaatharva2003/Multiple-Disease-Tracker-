### Multiple Disease Tracker - README

#### Overview
**Multiple Disease Tracker** is a predictive web application designed to assist users in assessing the likelihood of various diseases by analyzing their health data. This project utilizes machine learning models trained on real-world datasets to predict the presence of diseases such as Diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, and Heart Disease.

#### Features
- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Supports prediction for multiple diseases based on user-provided health metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface allowing users to input their data and receive predictions.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Employs robust machine learning models for accurate and reliable disease prediction.

#### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - `sklearn`: For building and evaluating predictive models.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `scikit-learn`: For model training and prediction.
- **Data Sources**: Kaggle datasets for training and validation.
- **Model Persistence**: Models are serialized using `pickle` for efficient storage and retrieval.
